#### Class Notes

- Richards equation used to model variably saturated flow
- Saturated flow --> assumes all pores filled with water (uses Darcy's Law to model)
- Variably saturated flow --> some pores filled with water, some with air (K nonlinear)
- K constant for saturated flow, so behaves linearly
- Simulating saturated parts of GW, not the vadose zone
  - Any recharge goes immediately into the saturated areas rather than infiltrating down through unsaturated zones
- K changes with saturation (via changes in Van Genuchten parameters)


Does the model still fit to other data after calibration?
Have to remember validation step (testing model on data after calibration)
Can overfit without knowing it if you use all of your data to train. Have nothing to train your model on.

Can the data be trusted if I have changed each water budget to match each home???
